There are useful service calls you can use from the command line

To enable sensing at a table
rosservvice call 
rosservice call /gearbox/enable_screw_sensing std_srvs/Bool 
rosservice call /gearbox/enable_gear_sensing std_srvs/Bool 
rosservice call /gearbox/enable_gearbox_sensing std_srvs/Bool

it is best to disable sensing after you have finished, before leaving the table
rosservice call /gearbox/disable_sensing std_srvs/Bool

to pick a piece, while sensing is enabled
rosservice call /gearbox/grasp_top std_srvs/Bool
rosservice call /gearbox/grasp_bottom std_srvs/Bool
rosservice call /gearbox/grasp_screw std_srvs/Bool

In rviz, there are several point clouds published at varrying levels of processing.
The two most useful are 

/objects_cloud
which shows the clusters of objects detected and

/gears_cloud
which shows the actual detected objects, after additional logic has been applied such as expected height and length of the clusters
